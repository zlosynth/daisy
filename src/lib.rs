#![no_std]

//! Rust `no_std`, `embedded_hal` board support package for the Electro-Smith Daisy platform.
//!
//! * [Documentation](https://zlosynth.com/daisy)
//! * [Crate (crates.io)](https://crates.io/crates/daisy)
//! * [Repository (github.com)](https://github.com/zlosynth/daisy)
//!
//! # Supported boards
//!
//! Currently this library supports following boards:
//!
//! * [Daisy Seed](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/daisy) (codec AK4556), `seed`
//! * [Daisy Seed 1.1](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/daisy) (codec WM8731), `seed_1_1`
//! * [Daisy Seed 1.2](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/daisy) (codec PCM3060), `seed_1_2`
//! * [Daisy Patch SM](https://www.electro-smith.com/daisy/patch-sm) (codec PCM3060), `patch_sm`
//!
//! Select the board by using its respective feature.
//!
//! # Sampling rate
//!
//! By default, the audio sampling rate is set to 48 kHz. This can be increased to
//! 96 kHz by enabling the `sampling_rate_96khz` feature.
//!
//! # Block length
//!
//! By default, the audio block length is 32 frames. This can be increased to 64
//! by enabling the `block_length_64` feature.
//!
//! # API stability
//!
//! I am still trying to figure out a good API for the project. Expect it to change.
//! To mitigate breakage of your code on library update, use macros defined under
//! `board.rs` to initialize resources whenever possible.
//!
//! # HAL compatibility
//!
//! This library is closely tied to [stm32h7xx-hal](https://github.com/stm32-rs/stm32h7xx-hal/).
//! Make sure to use compatible versions in your `Cargo.toml`.
//!
//! | **Daisy**   | **HAL** |
